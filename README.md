Hi Finn,

In case you forgot what you've achieved in the future, here is something to look at. You did comment in the files to explain why and how to do it. And also look up package.json to find out what package to install.  
Mainly you use:

---

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
  - for styling and that's awesome because it's a really good component library for React.
    - The theme setting was cool.
  - [data grid](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/) in data layout out and come with awesome functionality. ( sort data, download as SCV... etc. )
  - [icons](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/) (kinda like font-awesome).
  - [Accordion](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-accordion/) basic tool.
- [FullCalendar ](https://fullcalendar.io/)

  - a React calendar component to interact with.
  - sorts of plugins to add to the calendar component.

- [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/)

  - for data present, like pie charts, bar charts, and even geography charts!
  - good intro, and is easy to use.

- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
  - An open-source form library for React.
  - use [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for object schema validation.
- [react-pro-sidebar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pro-sidebar)
  - stylish sidebar for React.
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

  - HashRouter for route

- VScode extension

  - [Tailwind Shade] to convert hex code to more shade (cmd+k cmd+g)

- Chrome extension

  - [Toogle Pastiside] to look up css grid layout on specific page
      

- ### Migrate to Vite from Create React App (CRA)

  - reduce project physical size
